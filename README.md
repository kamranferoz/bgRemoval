This program is an Image Background Remover application built with Streamlit. It allows users to upload an image in 'png', 'jpg', or 'jpeg' format. The program uses the rembg library to remove the background from the uploaded image.

The application displays the original image and the image with the background removed side by side for comparison. If the uploaded image is larger than 5MB, the program displays an error message.

Users can download the image with the background removed directly from the sidebar. The application also includes a sidebar with links to the developer's LinkedIn profile, the source code of the application, and the library used to remove the image background.

The application is designed to hide the main menu of Streamlit for a cleaner user interface. If no image is uploaded, the program will remove the background from a default image.

The working sample can be found at https://bgclean.streamlit.app/
